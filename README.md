# Diabetes-Prediction-System

Business Understanding

As a healthcare startup, our primary goal is to leverage predictive analytics to enhance decision-making for healthcare systems, particularly in diabetes management. Diabetes is a critical public health challenge, and our predictive model aims to assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at high risk of diabetes. By enabling early detection and intervention, we aim to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

The business objective is to develop a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a variety of demographic, lifestyle, and medical variables. Predictor variables include factors like age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and smoking history. The target variable, diabetes, is binary, classifying individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic. Success metrics include achieving an accuracy of 90% or higher, improving early diagnosis rates by 15%, and integrating predictive insights into healthcare management platforms seamlessly.

Key stakeholders include data scientists, project managers, and healthcare providers. This report reflects
the preliminary development phase based on an initial dataset and serves as the foundation for a scalable
solution.
